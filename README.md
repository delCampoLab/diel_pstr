This project was completed over 3 days starting at 12AM on the 15th of October, 2022 and ending at 6PM on the 17th for a total of 12 sampling time-points (over 6 hour intervals). Coral tissue biopsies (~1cm3) were collected in triplicate from the scleractinian coral Pseudodiploria strigosa using standard wire cutters at each time-point (n=36), stored in individually sealed bags (Uline, Florida, USA) and processed at the CARMABI marine research station (Collection Permit # 2022/021467).

All coral samples were co-extracted using the Zymobiomics DNA/RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) with a slight modification to the manufacturers protocol, increasing the duration of bead-beating from 5 minutes to 40 minutes. 

See [this Github page](https://github.com/bweiler89/coral_zymo_co-extractions) for full nucleic acid extraction details.

The coral samples were sequenced for both DNA and RNA, exploring the prokaryotic and microeukaryotic fractions of the microbiome, as well as the transcriptomic response of the coral host.
